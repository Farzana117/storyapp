			Vijay and Raju were friends. On a holiday they went walking into a forest, enjoying the beauty of nature. Suddenly they saw a bear coming at them. They became frightened.
			<br><br>
			Raju, who knew all about climbing trees, ran up to a tree and climbed up quickly. He didn’t think of Vijay. Vijay had no idea how to climb the tree.
			<br><br>
			Vijay thought for a second. He’d heard animals don’t prefer dead bodies, so he fell to the ground and held his breath. The bear sniffed him and thought he was dead. So, it went on its way.
			<br><br>
			Raju asked Vijay;
			<br><br>
			<i>“What did the bear whisper into your ears?”</i><br><br>
			Vijay replied, “The bear asked me to keep away from friends like you” …and went on his way.
			<br><br>
			<b>Moral of the story:</b><br>
				<b><i>A friend in need is a friend indeed.</i></b>
