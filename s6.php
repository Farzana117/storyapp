			It was an incredibly hot day, and a lion was feeling very hungry.
			<br><br>
			He came out of his den and searched here and there. He could find only a small hare. He caught the hare with some hesitation. “This hare can’t fill my stomach” thought the lion.
			<br><br>
			As the lion was about to kill the hare, a deer ran that way. The lion became greedy. He thought;
			<br><br>
			<i>“Instead of eating this small hare, let me eat the big deer.”</i>
			<br><br>
			He let the hare go and went behind the deer. But the deer had vanished into the forest. The lion now felt sorry for letting the hare off.

			<b>Moral of the story:</b><br>
				<b><i>A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.</i></b>
