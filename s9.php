			One afternoon a fox was walking through the forest and spotted a bunch of grapes hanging from over a lofty branch.
			<br><br>
			<i>“Just the thing to quench my thirst,”</i> he thought.
			<br><br>
			Taking a few steps back, the fox jumped and just missed the hanging grapes. Again the fox took a few paces back and tried to reach them but still failed.
			<br><br>
			Finally, giving up, the fox turned up his nose and said, <i>
			“They’re probably sour anyway,” and proceeded to walk away.
			</i>
			<br><br>
			<b>Moral of the story:</b><br>
				<b><i>It’s easy to despise what you can’t have.</i></b>
