			A slave, ill-treated by his master, runs away to the forest. There he comes across a lion in pain because of a thorn in his paw. The slave bravely goes forward and removes the thorn gently.
			<br><br>
			The lion without hurting him goes away.
			<br><br>
			Some days later, the slave’s master comes hunting to the forest and catches many animals and cages them. The slave is spotted by the masters’ men who catch him and bring him to the cruel master.
			<br><br>
			The master asks for the slave to be thrown into the lion’s cage
			<br><br>
			The slave is awaiting his death in the cage when he realizes that it is the same lion that he had helped. The slave rescued the lion and all other caged animals.

				<b><i>One should help others in need, we get the rewards of our helpful acts in return.</i></b>
